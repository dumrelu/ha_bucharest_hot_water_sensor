# Bucharest Hot Water Sensor
A simple Home Assistant integration that let's you select one or more Bucharest Thermal Points and exposes a binary sensor for each, telling you if the point is currently providing hot water or not(true means you have hot water). 

It does this by polling the [CMTEB website](https://www.cmteb.ro/functionare_sistem_termoficare.php) and searching if there is any information related to your thermal point or not.
